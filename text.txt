[Hero Section]
- Profile Image: A space for a profile image of myself at my work desk.
- Introduction: "Enter a another world, where everyone can have the 'Superpower' to be a Hero"
- Description: Empowered by artifice, go to the next level of what's possible and start making for yourself the tools, armour and pages of your next story. Taking the step to see how coding is created and read will unlock the limitless possibilities from staging your ideas, to making real change for others. But with great power comes great responsibility. Be the developer that builds with purpose, and keeps a mind sharp through learning, community, and a healthy dose of omega-3s.
- Fun Fact: I believe programming and storytelling share a core principle: both require logic and creativity to craft something meaningful.
