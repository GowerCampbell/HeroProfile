[Hero Section]
- A space for a profile image of myself at my work desk.
- Hobbies: I'm a reader, storyteller, and volunteer. My time working as a teaching assistant in schools has shown me the importance of sharing those experiences to inspire others. I'm about keeping my mind active through learning new skills, staying social, and connecting with friends, family, and the community.

I believe the things we eat greatly impact both our body and brain. I have a love for fish and omega-3-rich foods, which are vital for maintaining brain health and boosting the ability to learn and remember. I enjoy coming up with imaginative ideas, staying joyful and relaxed, and responsibly attending to what needs to be done.

Exploring my inner superpowers and the worlds that spark creativity is a journey I cherish. As part of my mission as a hero, I aim to ensure everyone is healthy and thriving

- A fun fact: "I believe programming and storytelling share a core principle: both require logical reasoning and creativity to craft engaging, functional, and impactful results."
